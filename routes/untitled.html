    <span id='m1' class='menu'>Skyfall</span>
    <span id='m1_desc' class='description'>Agent 007 turned 50 with rare panache: Directed by Sam Mendes, "Skyfall" is a contender for one of the top Bonds ever. It's not so much the probing, psychological script, but the nuanced, inspired performances by Judi Dench, Javier Bardem and Daniel Craig, of course -- and stunning cinematography by Roger Deakins.</span>

    <span id='m2_desc' class='description'>Maybe the best use of 3-D yet, Ang Lee's visually intoxicating treatment of Yann Martel's prize-winning novel about a boy (Suraj Sharma) lost at sea with only a tiger for company is an exquisite poetic fable that also bares ferocious teeth.</span>

    <span id='m3_desc' class='description'>David O. Russell is the perfect director to undercut the schmaltzy bromides without selling short his characters in this screwball romance about the bipolar product (Bradley Cooper) of your typical American dysfunctional family (Robert De Niro and Jacki Weaver). There's also a standout performance from Jennifer Lawrence.</span>

    <span id='m4_desc' class='description'>"Frankenweenie" and "The Cabin in the Woods" are tied for the 10th spot on this list of 2012's best films. Horror movies rarely get respect in year-end lists, but of the three films scripted or co-scripted by Joss Whedon this year ("The Avengers" and "Much Ado About Nothing" were the others), "The Cabin in the Woods" was the most fiendishly ingenious -- a horror movie that was truly out of the box. As for "Frankenweenie," pictured, this 3-D black-and-white tribute to classic Universal monster movies showed yet again that Tim Burton is most himself in animated film.</span>
